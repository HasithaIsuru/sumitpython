Knights Tour of a Chess Board
Run it using the following command
python KnightTourAgain.py 5 2 2
Where the 1st Param is the size of the Chess Board
2nd and 3rd Params are the starting location of the knight.
The coordinates start from top left in the board which is (1,1)

So for example the command
python KnightTourAgain.py 5 2 2

will return the set of Knight moves which are all unique for a 5X5 chess board

However

python KnightTourAgain.py 5 1 1 

Will fail to find out a knight tour starting from 1,1
